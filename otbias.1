.SH NAME
bias \- calculate anode current and dissipation using the output transformer method

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bias
Vcentre Vanode Rtransformer [Ianode]

.SH DESCRIPTION
You use
.B bias
to calculate anode current and dissipation of a power valve by
measuring voltages on the output transformer. It takes three or four
arguments:

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B Vcentre
Voltage from the output transformer centre tap to ground, in Volts.
.TP
.B Vanode
Voltage from the anode to ground (this can usually be measured from
the transformer as well as from the correct pin on the valve socket),
in Volts.

.P
Both voltages are measured on a
.I live
amplifier that has had a couple of minutes to warm up and stabilise,
and with the volume at 0.

.TP
.B Rtransformer
DC resistance in Ohms between the centre tap and the anode, meansured
with the amplifier turned
.I off
(obviously). You might want to drain the filter capacitors before
doing this.

.P
Optionally followed by:

.TP
.B Ianode
desired anode current in Amperes (not mA). This will calculate the voltage drop between centre
tap and anode corresponding to this anode current, for easy biasing.

.SH EXAMPLE
.EX
$ bias 250 247.76 109 .031
centre tap voltage            = 250 V
anode voltage                 = 247.8 V
output transformer resistance = 109 Î©
desired anode current         = 31 mA

voltage drop                  = 2.24 V
anode current                 = 20.55 mA
anode dissipation             = 5.092 W

desired voltage drop          = 3.379 V
